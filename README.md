# puppet-lint-security-iac

Hey you! üëã  Do you have experience in Puppet or similar tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, Chef) and appreciate security? Then, we would very much appreciate your colaboration. üòä ‚ñ∂Ô∏è   [https://puppet-study.herokuapp.com/](https://puppet-study.herokuapp.com/)

‚ö†Ô∏è  This is still work in progress! 

This linter identifies 9 security vulnerabilities in Puppet scripts. 

- Admin By Default Credentials
- Empty Passwords
- Hard-Coded Secrets (password, user, keys)
- Invalid IP Address Binding
- Use of HTTP without TLS
- Usage of Weak Crypto Algorithms (e.g., sha1 and md5)
- Usage of Weak Passwords ([strong_password](https://github.com/bdmac/strong_password) gem to validate if weak)
- Suspicious Comments
- Homograph Attacks (e.g., [Apple](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/))
